"""NFR-023 activation records of the discussion model (plan assess-llm-runner, task E).

``assess_model_activations`` is the append-only list of (provider, model, prompt_version) triples
allowed to answer students, each with the SHA-256 of the eval report that justified it. The admin
endpoint ``POST /api/v1/assess/admin/model-activations`` appends a row only for a report that passes
its recomputation; startup and the Part B pre-flight refuse a triple with no passing row. A new
prompt_version (any template, shipped string or lexicon change) is a new triple: rows are never
updated, superseded rows stay as audit evidence.

Grants: the API may INSERT and SELECT (the endpoint and the startup check), the worker SELECT only
(pre-flight); no role may UPDATE or DELETE. The whole matrix is re-rendered, as revision 0020 did.
