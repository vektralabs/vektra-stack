"""One reply at a time: ``pending_reply_since`` maintained by ``assess_append_turn`` (plan 8).

A student turn sets ``assess_sessions.pending_reply_since``; the bot turn that answers it (normal
or the marked "risposta interrotta") clears it. While it is set, a second student turn is refused
by the function itself (NULL), under the session row lock, so two tabs of the same owner can never
add two student turns in a row, whatever the API does. The reconciliation job (plan M3.6) finds an
abandoned pending turn by this column.

``assess_append_turn`` keeps its signature, owner and grants (``CREATE OR REPLACE``); the definer
role gets UPDATE on the new column (the matrix is re-rendered from ``vektra_assess.db.grants``).
